                    The amendment stipulated the conditions for the withdrawal of the U.S. following the Spanish-American War. It required that Cuba would not transfer
                    land to any power other than the U.S. and the naval base Guant√°namo Bay must be handed over to the United States.
                    On the 1901, the articles were incorporated in the constitution. Upon the removal of U.S. troops, Cuba became a republic. ("Platt Amendment")
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Cuban people viewed the admendment as an infringement of their sovereignty. ("Platt Amendment")

                    Palma planned to implement progressive policies, however he was plagued by instability. Upon being accused of rigging the election,
                    and commiting pension fraud and failure to deliver on his promises, a revolution was triggered forcing him to resign ("Cuban Revolution").

                    Throughout Fidel Castro's time as a student, he participated in numerous revolutionary activities. In 1952, he was the candidate for the
                    people's party, however Batista's coup stopped the election. In 1953, Castro led 160 men in an unsuccessful raid hoping to spark an uprising against
                    Batista's dictatorship ("Cuban Revolution") ("Fulgencio Batista").
